atom-fstar: Syntax highlighting for F* in Atom Editor
=====================================================

### Installation

Download and install [Atom] for your platform

[Atom]: https://atom.io/

Run `apm link` from the root directory of this repository.

Any file with a `.fst` `.fsti` `.fs7` extension will be recognised as F* grammar.
For now, the package defines only syntax highlighting.

### Running an F\* project

Install the [atom-script] package. Make sure fstar is in your path. If using linux, you may need to rename 'fstar.exe' to 'fstar'.
